# Pan-Arctic Behavioral and Life-history Simulator for Calanus (PASCAL v4.0)
## Overview
PASCAL is the 4th iteration of a very-high biological resolution behavioral and life-history simulation model designed for the copepods of genus _Calanus_ inhabiting the North Atlantic and the Arctic. It was initiated in 2016 under the VISTA PhD project of Kanchana Bandara (Akvaplan niva AS, Norway), titled "High-Resolution Modelling of Diel and Seasonal Vertical Migration of High-Latitude Zooplankton" supervised by Ketil Eiane (Nord University, Norway), Ã˜ystein Varpe (University of Bergen) and Rubao Ji (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, USA). Since its inception, PASCAL recieved 2 subsequent upgrades; PASCAL v2.0 in 2018 under the same VISTA project and and PASCAL v3.1 in 2021 under the NFR GLIDER Phase - I project with the oversight of Vigdis Tverberg (Nord University, Norway). PASCAL v4.0 is the latest iteration that sees an overhaul of the core model architecture and brings improved performance. A basic comparison of the four versions of PASCAL is listed below:
